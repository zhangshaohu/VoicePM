# VoicePM
We develop a tradeoff metric to capture voice biometrics as well as different voice attributes including age, accent, gender, and emotion. VoicePM is a robust Voice Privacy Measurement framework, to study the feasibility of applying different state-of-the-art voice anonymization solutions to achieve the optimum tradeoff between privacy and utility.

## Dataset
Mozilla Common Voice (English, 83,242 samples, 7,499 speakers) 

IEMOCAP (Emotion, English, 5,531 samples, 10 speakers)

AISHELL-1 (Mandarin Chinese, 7,176 samples, 400 speakers)

## Anonymization Models
Signal processing (McAdams Interspeech'21 & VoiceMask/VTLN Sensys'18)

Voice synthesis (HiFi-GAN NIPS'20)

Voice conversion (MaskCycleGAN ICASSP'21)

Voice adversarial examples (V-CLOAK Security'23)
